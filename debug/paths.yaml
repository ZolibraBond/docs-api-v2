    The `shutdown` field indicates the power state of the Wi-Fi (+BLE) radio:
       - `0`: normal operation
       - `1`: low-power shutdown mode

    If the `shutdown` field is not present, assume normal operation.

  description: |
    Use this endpoint to manually control LEDs, such as during factory test.
    Be sure to use the `manual` field to prevent `value` from being overridden
    from automatic LED control.

    If `manual` is `0` or absent, `value` may still be set, but may be overridden
    at any time.

    All these settings require `manual` to be set before they take effect.

    Use this endpoint only as part of an FCC or factory test program.

    NOTE: In production firmware, FCC compliance is ensured via power,
    frequency, and antenna restrictions on this endpoint.
    If a setting beyond FCC limits is requested, a `200` will be returned,
    but upon subsequent GET, the values may either be unchanged or truncated.

    Every log message is sent in a seperate UDP packet.
    Depending on log verbosity, this may cause serious performance problems,
    so use wisely.
