  summary: Cancel a Transmission
  description: |
    If a Signal is being transmitted, it is immediately interrupted,
    and a 204 is returned.

    A 204 is also returned even if there was no Signal being transmitted.

    NOTE: Internally, this flushes the radio command queue,
     so any requested transmissions which were queued
     waiting for an earlier tranmission to complete will also be canceled.
     This also cancels any queued scans, but does not cancel a scan already in progress.
