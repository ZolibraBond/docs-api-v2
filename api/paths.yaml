  summary: Configure MQTT Transport
  description: |
    Configure the Bond's MQTT Transport, which is used for communication
    with the Bond Cloud or an offline MQTT broker.
    Note that Bond uses MQTT over TLS with certificate-based authentication.
    Password-based authentication is not supported.

    Some advanced users may elect to run their own MQTT brokers,
    so this endpoint allows customizing of the MQTT broker address
    and the various related security settings.

    Note that any manipulation of this endpoint will result in the
    Bond disconnecting from Bond Cloud, and therefore integrations
    and control away from home will become unavailable.
    
    NOTE: All settings only take effect after reboot.
