        When enabled is false (2 and 0 in v3.x.x), paired will always be false.
        When enabled is true, paired means:
          - false (default): Bond is not paired to an account and is discoverable by the HomeKit Protocol.
          - true: Bond is paired and is not discoverable.

        The HomeKit Setup Code is your Bond PIN two times.
        For example, if your Bond PIN is "1234", your HomeKit Setup Code is "12341234".

          That means the Bond will delete all info, unpairing if paired and set enabled to default (0).
          If you have not removed the Bond from your account on Home app, the Bond and its devices
          will show as not responding. You can remove from the Home app later as usual.
